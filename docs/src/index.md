# WindowAbstractions.jl

Abstractions for windowing APIs. This library is intended for developers, and not for general use. It is currently only used by [XCB.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGL/XCB.jl) and [Wayland.jl](https://github.com/serenity4/Wayland.jl), but aims at being applicable to other windowing APIs such as Windows. Julia developers wrapping windowing APIs are encouraged to use and contribute to this library as much as possible.
