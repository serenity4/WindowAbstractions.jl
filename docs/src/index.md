# WindowAbstractions.jl

Abstractions for windowing APIs. This library is intended for developers, and not for general use. It is currently only used by [XCB.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGL/XCB.jl), but aims at being applicable for other windowing APIs (such as Windows and Wayland). Julia developers wrapping windowing APIs are encouraged to use and contribute to this library as much as possible.
